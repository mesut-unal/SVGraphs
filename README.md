# SV Graphs
This app is designed to find the links between different genomic sections by using graph theory. It takes a json files (JaBba output) as an input, constructs graph network with Networkx, finds the longest chain of genes. 

The secondary objective is to create a Streamlite API for drawing the longest network chain in an interactive canvas as well as a table for all the genomic data in an interactive table. The dev branch link for the app is:
